What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When a repository is initialized, an invisible .git directory is created, 
	and we are informed that an empty Git repository has been created. When we 
	run a 'git status' it shows us the files in our directory as 'untracked files' 
	since there are still no commits in our repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The working directory is simple the folder on the machine where all the current 
	files are located. The staging area is where files get placed before a commit is created 
	for the current status of the files. The staging area gives us a quick snapshot of what 
	reflects the latest changes made before we commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
